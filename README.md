## About me
Hi, I’m @etienneoh ! A young developper interested in web development 💻 and software engineering 👨‍💻. I'm currently studying computer science technologies in Quebec ⚜, Canada 🍁.
Next, I'm going to do a software engineer bachelor's degree 📝.

#### Projects I'm working on:
>These are advancing slowly during my free time, as I'm working as an IT solutions architect part-time and studying full-time.
- A custom portfolio website, without the use of any framework, using libraries such as Three.js and Anime.js.
- A companion app for the tabletop game Munckin using React.js.
- A non-intrusive family app for ease of communications using Flutter.
- A web app using Appsmith to compare two NHL players for fantasy hockey purposes.

#### Languages I enjoy:
1. C#
2. Python
3. HTML/CSS/Javscript
